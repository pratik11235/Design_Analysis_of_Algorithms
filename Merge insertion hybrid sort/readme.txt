About the project:

This project is a part of CSE 5311 course work at University of Texas at Arlington under the guidance of prof. Md Hasanuzzaman Noor. 

We have implemented 3 different sorting algorithms i.e. insertion sort, merge sort and hybrid merge-insertion sort and compared their performances.

Insertion Sort: Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.

Merge Sort: The Merge Sort algorithm is a sorting algorithm that is considered an example of the divide and conquer strategy.The array is initially divided into two equal halves and then they are combined in a sorted manner.

Hybrid merge-insertion sort: As the name suggests, this algorithm is a hybrid sorting algorithm that uses merge and insertion sort. A hybrid sorting algorithm is a blending of two different sorting algorithms, typically, a divide-and- conquer algorithm, like merge-sort, combined with an incremental algorithm, like insertion-sort.

The code is written using Python 3.9.
